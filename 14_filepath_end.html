    <!-- Understanding file path
  picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page
  <img src="picture.jpg"> 
  picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder
  <img src="images/picture.jpg">
  picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
  <img src="/images/picture.jpg">
  picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder
  <img src="../picture.jpg"> -->

    <p>
      Absolute File Paths: An absolute file path is the full URL to an internet
      file:
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

    <p>
      Relative File Paths A relative file path points to a file relative to the
      current page. In this example, the file path points to a file in the
      images folder located at the root of the current web:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/line2.jpeg" alt="Mountain" />

    <p>
      In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
      located in the current folder:
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/line2.jpeg"
      style="width:250px;height:300px;"
      alt="Mountain"
    />

    <p>
      In this example, the file path points to a file in the images folder
      located in the folder one level above the current folder:
    </p>
    <img src="../images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain" />

        <h1>
          Best Practice
        </h1>
        <p>
          It is best practice to use relative file paths (if possible).
        </p>
        <p>
          When using relative file paths, your web pages will not be bound to
          your current base URL. All links will work on your own computer
          (localhost) as well as on your current public domain and your future
          public domains.
